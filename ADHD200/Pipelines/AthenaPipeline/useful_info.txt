ADHD200_CC400_TCs_filtfix

Within ADHD200_CC400_TCs_filtfix - resting state fMRI and voxel based morphometry preprocessing (grey matter) using AFNI and FSL. Now contains the test dataset.

Extracted Time Courses
Time courses were extracted from filtered and unfiltered preprocessed resting state data using the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) [7], Eickhoff-Zilles (EZ) [8], Talairach and Tournoux (TT) [9], and Harvard-Oxford (HO) anatomical atlases, as well as, 200 (CC200) and 400 (CC400) ROI atlases derived from functionally parcellating the resting state data [10].

CC400 Time Courses (http://www.nitrc.org/frs/downloadlink.php/3424) - this segmentation variant has been used in research for Athena-based pipeline.

Archive files include phenotypic information for each site, atlases used to extract time courses, and time course text files for filtered and unfiltered preprocessed data from subject, scan, and dataset.
